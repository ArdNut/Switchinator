## How to build the code

All you need to do is download the source as a zip file (there is a button
that will do that for you), and then unzip it into a directory called
"Switchinator" in your Arduino "sketchbook" directory.

Refer to Chapter 10 for instructions on how to test the code to verify that
it is working correctly with the hardware.
